INT. UPSTAIRS LIVING ROOM

ZACH sits at the table painting war hammer figurines, looking 
very closely. PALLY sits on the couch playing video games.

                     PALLY
             Do you ever worry you’ll inhale 
             some of the paint fumes by 
             accident?

                     ZACH
             Pshh don’t threaten me with a good 
             time.

                     PALLY
                 (laughing)
             What!? Did you just make that up??

                     ZACH
             Uh no it’s a thing...
TREVOR comes up the stairs.

                     TREVOR
             Hey anyone feel like getting a pizza?

                     PALLY
             Hah! Don’t threaten me with a good time!

                     ZACH
             No, it doesn’t really work there...

                     PALLY
             Cause I take that as a threat!

                     TREVOR
             What’s going on?

                     ZACH
             Nothing he doesn’t understand...

                     PALLY
             You’re gonna come in here making threats?!

                     TREVOR
             I just asked if you wanted a pizza!

                     PALLY
             STOP THREATENING ME!

                     TREVOR
             Okay! Okay!

Trevor leaves.

Pally turns to Zach.

                     PALLY
                 (shrugs)
             Guess he doesn’t get the joke.
