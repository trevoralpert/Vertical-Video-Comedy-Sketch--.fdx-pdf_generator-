    - Match the tone, pacing, and structure of the following reference sketch:
    ---
    {reference_script}
    ---

    Here are the parameters for the new sketch:
    - **Topic**: {topic or "Any topic you choose"}
    - **Characters**: {character_list}
    - **Target duration**: approximately {duration} seconds

    Only include characters from this list: {character_list}
    Do not invent or include any other characters.

    Output only the script in screenplay format.
    Your output should follow the indentation and spacing conventions exactly.
    Match the structure, layout, and formatting of the reference sketch above.

    Match the layout, indentation, and formatting style of the reference sketch exactly.
